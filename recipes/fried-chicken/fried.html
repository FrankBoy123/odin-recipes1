    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken. This is it!</p>
    <p>It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Chicken: </strong>Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.</li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk: </strong>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</li>
    </ol>
